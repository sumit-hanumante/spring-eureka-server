Service Registration and Discovery

Exqmple of Netflix Eureka service registry


we are setting up a Netflix Eureka service registry and 
then build a client that both registers itself with the registry and
uses it to resolve its own host.

 A service registry is useful because it enables client-side load-balancing and
 decouples service providers from consumers without the need for DNS.
